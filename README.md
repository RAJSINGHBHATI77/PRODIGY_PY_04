# PRODIGY_PY_04
Python-based Sudoku Solver that uses backtracking to fill incomplete 9×9 grids. Recursion + validation logic ensure the solution follows Sudoku rules.
# Task-04: Sudoku Solver 🧠

## 🎯 Objective:
Create a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking. It accepts an unsolved 9x9 grid and fills it following Sudoku rules.

## 💡 Features:
- Accepts predefined grid
- Uses recursive backtracking to solve
- Displays original and solved board
- Validates input placement per Sudoku rules

## 🔍 Sample Output:
Unsolved Sudoku Board:  
5 3 . . 7 . . . .  
6 . . 1 9 5 . . .  
. 9 8 . . . . 6 .  
...

Solved Sudoku Board:  
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2  
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8  
...

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- Python 3  
- Recursive functions  
- Matrix traversal  
- Backtracking algorithm

## ✅ Conclusion:
This task demonstrates the power of recursion and search algorithms — ideal for logic building and interview prep.# PRODIGY_PY_04
